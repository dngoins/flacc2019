### 7 Basic Steps to build Augmented Reality (VR, MR, AR) apps

1. Act out your experience
   - answering this question gives you insight as to what device form factor you're going to use. Is it a phone, tablet, or wearable device like Magic Leap 1 or HoloLens 1 or 2.
   - Act out the experience with a skit, or real actors if you have the budget. Get in front of a crowd with a prop and deliver your experience.
   - Take in all the feedback
2. Choose your device
   - Take in all your feedback figure out which form factor yields the best return on investment.
   - Determine if you want reach or reaction.
   - Reach means more people with the experience, which typically means mobile device like a phone.
   - Reaction means a more cultivating response to the experience and typically means a VR, MR or AR experience. This also means today - not everyone has a VR/MR/AR device.
   - These two are not mutually exclusive.
3. Choose your platform
   - There are many devices to choose from: HoloLens, Magic Leap, Occulus Rift, HTC Vive, MR Headsets from Acer, HP, Samsung, Google glasses, phones tablets, etc. 
   - Choose one based on Reach vs Reaction, or Reach AND reaction. Another way you can look at this is Enterprise vs Consumer.
   - Choose one based on developer skillset in your team. 
   - Choose one based on documentation and community
4. Build out your scenes and transitions
   - Understand there's a difference with VR vs AR vs MR when we deal with Scene building.
   - With VR you must build everything. With AR and MR you can use the world around you.
   - Understand with VR you can potentially get the most Reaction - i.e. falling on the floor, extreme laughter and genuine fear.
   - Understand with VR it will be considerably longer to build, test, deploy, and package.
   - Understand with AR/MR there are potentially more use cases to accept more experiences.
5. Add in your MR/VR/AR experiences
   - Use the platform, toolset to add in interactions with your experience
   - Things like sound, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, animation all yield great experiences
6. Package, Deploy and advertise your app
   - Most tools like Unity, Visual Studio, Unreal, can package your application into a format that is easily deployable.
   - Most platforms have a repository like a store to deploy
   - You can charge for your application
   - Advertisement is always an issue.
   - Best to advertise through community events like this one.
   - Forums, Usergroups, Slack channels, Reddit, Facebook and Twitter
7. Test, Test and Retest then repeat Steps 1 - 6.
